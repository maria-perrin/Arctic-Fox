## Biological Classification
Kingdom: Animalia

Phylym: Chordata

Class: Mammalia

Order: Carnivora

Family: Canidae

Genus: _Vulpes_

Species: _Vulpes lagopus_

Above is the taxonomic classification for the Arctic fox<sup>1</sup>.

Until recently, the Arctic fox was classified as _Alopex lagopus_ and many older papers will refer to it by that name.

## Geographical Range
The fox is found in the circumpolar north. The specific range is indicated in blue on the image below. They are considered a nomadic species, and will migrate more than 1000km in a season, however they will also establish territories and stay within that area<sup>2</sup>. However, during the winter they are more likely to leave their territory and become nomadic as they search for food, returning to their territory in the spring<sup>3</sup>.

The foxes are found in the Arctic, alpine tundra of Eurasia, North America, the Canadian archipelago, Siberian islands, Greenland, Iceland (inland and coastal regions), inland Svalbard, Aleutian island chain, Bering Sea Islands, and Commander Islands<sup>4</sup>.

## Natural Habitat
The natural habitat of the fox is the tundra areas of the circumpolar north, including North America, Eurasia, and the major islands of the Arctic including Greenland and Iceland<sup>5</sup>. The fox is the main predator throughout most of their habitat<sup>6</sup>. This is also considered a grassland habitat<sup>4</sup>.

## Conservation Status

_IUCN Redlist conservation status for the Arctic fox (I4)._

As the graphic above indicates, the Arctic fox is a species of least concern. However, this was not always the case. In fact, at the beginning of the 20th century, the foxes were hunted to near extinction and became protected in Finland in 1940, but did not respond, instead being labelled as critically endangered<sup>7</sup>.

## Physical Description
The Arctic fox has two colour variants, white and blue<sup>5</sup>. The blue variant will remain a similar colour year-round, while the white variant will be white in the winter but darken to brown and grey<sup>5</sup>. The white Variant of the fox makes up the majority of the population (99%) of inland regions, while the blue variant is more common in coastal regions<sup>5</sup>. The blue allele is dominant over the white allele<sup>8</sup>.

The Arctic fox ranges from 18-26.75 inches (45.7-67.9 cm) in length (including the head and body), while the tail can be up to 13.75 inches (34.9 cm) in length<sup>9</sup>. This gives a total length range of 80.6-102.8 cm, or 31.75-40.5 inches. The average weight is 3.5 kg<sup>10</sup>, but there is a range from 6.5-17 pounds (2.9-7.7 kg)<sup>9</sup>. In the wild, they live 3-6 years on average<sup>9</sup>.


## Life History/Biology
Arctic foxes are considered "lemming foxes" if they live inland where there are lemming populations, and "coastal foxes" if they live in coastal regions. The two groups have different diets and reproductive schemes<sup>11</sup>.

Lemming foxes have up to 18 pups in lemming years (or, years when lemming populations numbers are high) but will have few to none when the populations are low<sup>12</sup>. In contrast, coastal foxes will have about 5 pups per year every year and have 1 litter per year<sup>7</sup>. Lemming peaks are every 3-5 years, and Arctic fox population peaks will follow about a year behind that<sup>2</sup>, so lemming foxes will have one large litter every 3-5 years, while coastal foxes will have smaller litters yearly. The breeding season is from March to June<sup>13</sup>. By 3-4 months of age, juveniles have almost reached their adult size, however there may be an interruption in their growth in the fall which could be an adaptation to the potential shortage of food over the fall and winter<sup>14</sup>.

There are two main types of social groupings, simple and complex, where simple groups are small and made up of a mating pair and their cubs and complex groups are larger and may have several unrelated adults including nonbreeding individuals as well as breeding individuals and all of their pups<sup>8</sup>. There type of social group found varies with geographical region and food abundance, where complex groups were significantly more common in areas with higher food abundance<sup>8</sup>. In some regions, where Arctic fox populations overlap with other predator species such as the red fox, they may face predation from these other predators, which may also influence their social groupings<sup>8<</sup>.

Arctic foxes are most active from 9:00 pm to 4:00 am<sup>15</sup>, making them a nocturnal species. They are also considered an apex predator<sup>16</sup>.
## Adaptations to The Circumpolar North
Because the foxes live in the circumpolar north, they need to be able to survive a very wide range of temperatures, and as such had to adapt<sup>10</sup>. One adaptation they potentially have is the ability to reduce their basal metabolic rate, and they will change their eating habits during colder periods, possibly using cached foods<sup>10</sup>. There is conflicting data on whether or not the basal metabolic rate is actually lowered in the colder months as many studies found that they did not, while several others found that they did. The basal metabolic rate in the summer can be calculated using Kleiber's formula, but for the winter basal metabolic rate has values up to 50% lower than would be expected using that formula<sup>12</sup>.

In addition, the foxes may lower their core body temperature from the normal 39.8 (+/- 0.16) degrees celsius to 39.3 (+/- 0.33) degrees celsius, which was determined to be a significant difference, although this is not certain-many studies have conflicting findings on the matter<sup>12</sup>. The foxes will deposit large amounts of fat in preparation for the winter, and this allows them to survive without eating for around 30 days<sup>12</sup>.

Many species will increase movement to increase heat production, but Arctic foxes do not do this, instead reducing their activity<sup>6</sup>. They can change the insulative properties of their fur and skin to reduce heat dissipation when the ambient temperature is low<sup>6</sup>. As well, fur length increases significantly (almost 200%) in the winter months, with the longest fur being found in areas that will normally come into contact with snow, while other areas will have shorter fur<sup>6</sup>. When it is exposed to very low temperatures or wind, the fox will curl into a ball to reduce heat loss by reducing their surface:volume ratio and protect the less well insulated areas<sup>6</sup>. As well, the fox has also adapted a body shape to protect against colder temperatures-short legs, small ears, and a short muzzle<sup>6</sup>.

Further, there is positive selection for genes that are related to fatty acid metabolism (GLTPD1 and AKT2), one of which is also related to insulin signaling; this is important because insulin signaling helps regulate glucose uptake, stimulate lipogenesis, the synthesis of glycogen and protein, and inhibit lipolysis, glycogenolysis, and protein breakdown<sup>17</sup>. All of this helps the foxes survive in the harsh environment of circumpolar winters. The foxes may also deposit large amounts of fat, which is used as both insulation and energy stores<sup>13</sup>.
## Specialized Hunting Behaviour in Winter

_(I7)_

Snow is not only a concern for heat retention. Lemmings are a food source both in the summer and in the winter, when they live under the snow<sup>18</sup>. Since they are such an important food source, the Arctic fox also had to adapt a way of hunting them during this time period. In Northern Canada, the tundra is fairly windswept and this leaves the snow cover fairly thin in most areas, generally 30-50 cm in depth; however, this snow is hard packed<sup>18</sup>. The foxes have two methods of hunting the lemmings while they are under this snow<sup>18</sup>. Firstly, they will dig through the snow layer, mainly performing this method at lemming nests; the depth and hardness of the snow makes no difference to if they choose to perform this method or not<sup>18</sup>. Alternatively, they will remain motionless on top of the snow, listening until they locate a lemming beneath, at which point they leap up and punch through the snow to the tunnels (and prey) beneath, although shallower snow is preferred for this method (to a maximum depth of about 15 cm)<sup>18</sup>.
## A Fun Extra
 The video below is clearly not of a fox, however the action he is performing in it is similar to the pouncing behaviour foxes use to punch through the snow when hunting lemmings, so I included it as a fun (and cute) comparison. The dog is my own, 10 month old, border collie puppy "hunting" a toy that was dropped between the sections of a couch.

_Blitz (I8)_

(I also want to leave a note about the video. It occurred to me that when the video ends he looks pretty squished in there, so he looks like he could be stuck. He is not, he got out immediately after I stopped recording.)
