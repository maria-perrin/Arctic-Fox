The average weight for Arctic foxes is 3.5kg.

## Geographical Range
The fox is found in the circumpolar north. The specific range is indicated in blue on the image below. They are considered a nomadic species, and will migrate more than 1000km in a season.

## Life History/Biology
Arctic foxes are considered "lemming foxes" if they live inland where there are lemming populations, and "coastal foxes" if they live in coastal regions. The two groups have different diets and reproductive schemes.

Lemming foxes have up to 18 pups in lemming years (or, years when lemming populations numbers are high) but will have few to none when the populations are low. This is the largest litter size found in carnivores. In contrast, coastal foxes will have about 5 pups per year every year. the foxes have 1 litter per year. Lemming peaks are every 3-5 years, and Arctic fox population peaks will follow about a year behind that.
