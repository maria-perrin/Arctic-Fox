## Gastrointestinal System Diagram

The diagram above is the digestive system of the domestic dog, _Canis lupus familiaris,_ because it is comparable to the Arctic fox (_Vulpes lagopus_). Both species are carnivorous canids, although the Arctic fox is much smaller than the average dog. Labels: 1-stomach. 2-

## Digestive Physiology
The Arctic fox is an opportunistic carnivore, meaning that it primarily eats animal products (meat, eggs, etc) which are high in fats and proteins and low in carbohydrates (if they have any at all), although they have been found to eat small amounts of vegetation. They will also scavenge what they can when it is necessary, however those living in coastal regions have more of a generalist approach as they have access to a greater variety of prey species (8).

The overall digestive tract in carnivores is simple and fairly short, as it is adapted to digest concentrated and highly digestible diets (21). Carnivores rapidly ingest their food, and their stomachs are able to store quite a bit of food (17). The pH in the stomach ranges between 2.4 and 4.0, while the actual stomach acid has a pH ranging between 0.2 and 1.2 (17). The stomach is also a site of protein digestion (17). The small intestine is shortest in carnivores and is the main site of enzymatic digestion and absorption; it is split into three sections in mammals-the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum (17). The digestive secretions found in the small intestine are from the liver, pancreas, intestinal mucosa, and duodenal glands (17). The cecum occurs at the junction between the small and large intestines, however in carnivores they are typically rudimentary and nondigestive (17). Foxes have a small cecum with little function (21). The large intestine is about 6% the size of the small intestine in smaller carnivorous animals (17).

## Features Allowing Digestion of Natural Food and Utilization of Nutrients
The teeth are responsible for breaking up food into smaller pieces (17). Pepsin is the enzyme that allows digestion of protein, and can be found in the inactive form pepsinogen in the stomach, however it is activated by hydrochloric acid (pH <5) (17). This pepsin denatures proteins (17). Pancreatic secretions further break down proteins through the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, which results in free amino acids (17). Fats are digested by lipase and bile salts, from the pancreas and liver respectively (17). Fats are broken down into micelles, which are readily absorbable by the intestinal epithelium (17). A small amount of bacterial fermentation occurs in the cecum and colon (21).

The teeth of carnivores are used to kill and dismember prey, and may be used as a threat or weapon during confrontations with other non-prey animals (19). Canid carnivores tend to have fairly strong jaws as this is how they kill their prey (19). The front teeth (canines and incisors) are the ones used for killing, threatening, fighting, and dismembering, but these are not the only teeth a carnivore has; there are also premolars that pierce, the canassials which cut the food, and finally the postcarnassial molars which grind (20).

Much of the fats consumed by the fox during the late summer/early fall are presumably deposited, to be later mobilized during the winter months when food availability is limited. In the spring, these fats would go towards restoring normal fat stores.
