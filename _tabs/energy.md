## Basal Metabolic Rate for Maintenance
The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) for Arctic foxes varies from season to season, with a 36% increase from summer to winter (7). The lowest ever reported BMR is 471 kJ/day (4). Other reported values, which are more common, are 735 kJ/day and 883 kJ/day for winter months, when the temperature ranges between -7 and -40 degrees Celsius (4). For future equations, I will take the average of the normal BMR values, which is 809 kJ/day.

## Daily Energy Expenditure for Maintenance
Daily energy expenditure (DEE) is comparable to field metabolic rate (FMR). An estimate that has been determined is 1,925 kJ/day (4). However, FMR can vary a great deal, and a range of 721-5,140 kJ/day has been proposed (4). For simplicity, I will use 1,925 kJ/day for any future calculations that require DEE.

## Number of Lemmings Needed to Meet BMR and DEE

## Number of Snow Goose Eggs Needed to Meet BMR and DEE
For the lowest reported BMR, 471 kJ/day, it would take 143 fresh or 160 stored Snow Goose eggs to feed a fox from October to April. For the BMR of 883 kJ/day, this would be 197 fresh or 220 stored eggs for the same time period. Although these values were found in literature, I will include the math done to determine the values.

For an FMR of 1,925 kJ/day 429 fresh of 480 stored eggs are required to meet requirements for 6 months.
