## Lemmings
Lemmings are the main food source for inland Arctic foxes, to the point that the foxes that rely on them are considered "lemming foxes". Even in years when lemming populations are low, they are still the main food source for those foxes. Lemming populations peak every 3-4 years in general, although in the Wrangel Island region it is every 5 years.

## Snow Geese
Birds make up another important source of food for Arctic foxes, but in the case of Snow Geese, an important food source for foxes in the Bylot Island region in Nunavut is actually the goose eggs.

## Other Common foods
Arctic foxes will eat a variety of other things. Scavenged reindeer, birds (both passeriformes and marine birds), voles, shews, hares, insects, marine invertebrates, and some vegetation.

## Seasonal Availability of Foods
Lemmings are not exactly a seasonal food, however as previously mentioned, they are such an important part of the diet that foxes can be considered "lemming foxes" and there are years referred to as "lemming years". So while lemmings are not exactly seasonal, they are sort of worth mentioning here.

For lemmings, populations increase and decrease dramatically over short periods of time.

## Toxins, Anti-Nutrients, and Limiting Nutrients

## Nutritional Value and Energy Content of Lemmings

## Nutritional Value and Energy Content of Snow Goose Eggs
For fresh eggs, the fat content is about 14.4g (or around 44.8%) and protein content is about 16.1g (50.4%). There is an average of 873 kJ of energy. The metabolizable energy of fresh eggs was calculated to be 816 kJ. The masses of the fresh eggs, when dried, was an average of 31.97g, and since they were an average of 169.98g before moisture was removed, that makes the moisture content 81.2%.

However, as mentioned above the foxes also cache these eggs, so fat, protein, and energy contents were also calculated for stored eggs. When the eggs have been stored, the fat content is about 12.7g (43.8%) and the protein content was about 14.8g (51.3%). Ash content of stored eggs was 4.8%. The energy content has an average of 783 kJ. The metabolizable energy of stored eggs was calculated to be 730 kJ.
