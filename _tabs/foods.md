## Lemmings
Lemmings are the main food source for inland Arctic foxes, to the point that the foxes that rely on them are considered "lemming foxes". Even in years when lemming populations are low, they are still the main food source for those foxes<sup>11</sup>. Lemming populations peak every 3-4 years in general, although in the Wrangel Island region it is every 5 years<sup>2</sup>.

## Greater Snow Geese
Birds make up another source of food for Arctic foxes, but in the case of Greater Snow Geese, the important food source for foxes in the Bylot Island region in Nunavut is actually the goose eggs<sup>10</sup>. The eggs of geese are large, high in fat, and can be found in large groups<sup>10</sup>. The foxes do not eat the entire egg shell, although some shells were found in feces, which suggests that they may eat some of the shell<sup>10</sup>. The goslings are also eaten<sup>15</sup>. Foxes will cache as many as 1000 eggs per nesting season<sup>19</sup>.

## Other Common foods
Arctic foxes will eat a variety of other things. Birds, voles, shews, hares, insects, marine invertebrates, and some vegetation are all possibilities<sup>5</sup>. They will also scavenge muskoxen, reindeer, whales, and seals, and hunt ringed seal white pups, all of which make up some of their main food sources in the winter<sup>6</sup>. For foxes living in areas where lemmings are not available, birds, fish, shellfish, crustaceans, reindeer carcasses, sheep, and seals are the important winter foods<sup>5</sup>.

## Seasonal Availability of Foods
Lemmings are not exactly a seasonal food, however as previously mentioned, they are such an important part of the diet that foxes can be considered "lemming foxes" and there are years referred to as "lemming years". So while they are not exactly seasonal, they are still worth mentioning here because they play such an important role in the lifecycle and diet of inland foxes. Lemming peaks are every 3-5 years<sup>2</sup>, and outside of that there will be fewer lemmings available. As well, in the winter they live beneath the snow<sup>18</sup>, so it will be harder for the foxes to access them.

Goose eggs are also a seasonal food. They are only available during the time that the geese are nesting-otherwise they will have already been taken or they will hatch, and then goslings will be an available food source for some time before they grow up<sup>15</sup>. However, many eggs are cached<sup>15</sup>, so they are still available outside of the nesting season assuming the foxes are able to retrieve their caches.

Many other prey species are less abundant in the winter, and starvation will be one of the main causes of mortality during this time period; this is particularly noticeable in young foxes<sup>6</sup>. Foxes will feed on migratory birds<sup>16</sup>, which will not be available during the winter. Ptarmigans and hares are two of the food sources for the foxes, and are only available in the summer in some Northern regions, where snow cover makes it too difficult for them to find food during the winter months<sup>16</sup>.

In the winter, sea ice allows the coastal foxes to access marine foods that are not available to them in the summer unless they wash to shore as carrion<sup>3</sup>. Ringed seal pups can be killed by the foxes during the spring, but adult seals are eaten as carcasses left behind by larger predators<sup>3</sup>, meaning that the only time the pups are available as a food source is during the spring while they are still small. The availability of seal carcasses is directly related to sea ice, as this is what polar bears (the main source of seal carcasses to be scavenged) require to hunt, and therefore the current trend of global warming is making the season seal meat is available shorter<sup>3</sup>.

## Caching
To counteract the seasonal availability of some of their food sources, Arctic foxes will cache some of their prey. One of the foods cached are the eggs of the Greater Snow Goose<sup>15</sup>. Of the acquired eggs, up to 97% are cached for use up to a year later, and an average of 2.7-7.3 eggs may be taken per hour<sup>10</sup>. Lemmings and goslings are also be cached<sup>15</sup>. The low temperatures and permafrost found in the regions Arctic foxes live in make caching a viable option, as even perishable foods stay energy-rich for longer periods of time<sup>15</sup>. Eggs are cached more than other prey items, which may have to do with the fact that they are not very perishable-they will lose only a small percentage of their dry mass (<10%) during the summer months; another possibility is that the shell may make it harder for other animals to smell the eggs and therefore decrease the risk of the cache being pilfered<sup>15</sup>.

Arctic foxes perform both short term and long term caching<sup>15</sup>. Short term caching is performed more often by foxes that had pups to feed nearby, likely because it increases the amount of prey they can capture and bring back to the den; this is not performed with eggs, likely due to the fact that only one egg can be carried at a time<sup>15</sup>.

## Toxins, Anti-Nutrients, and Limiting Nutrients
As long as the Arctic fox consumes its natural diet, there should not be any toxins, anti-nutrients, or limiting nutrients.
## Nutritional Value and Energy Content of Lemmings
I was unable to find proximate analysis data for lemmings, so I chose to use the data for voles instead, as they are a similar species of comparable size and are from the same family as lemmings, and are also a food source for Arctic foxes. I have chosen data from the meadow and red-backed vole (_Microtus pennsylvanicus_ and _Clethrionomys gapperi_)<sup>20</sup>.

| Nutrient | Content |
|:--------:|:-------:|
| Dry Matter (%) | 32.0 |
| Crude Protein (%) | 62.5 |
| Crude Fat (%) | 15.5 |
| Ash (%) | 13.5 |
| Gross Energy (kcal/g) | 5.34 |

All of the above numbers are on a dry matter basis, so I will convert them to an as-fed basis below. The example formula below will be for crude protein. The equation below is from _Nutrient Requirements of Dogs and Cats_<sup>21</sup>.

$$ \frac{Dry\ Matter \%}{100} = \frac{As\ Fed \%}{Moisture\ Content} $$

$$ \frac{62.5}{100} = \frac{As\ Fed \%}{68.0} $$

$$ =42.5 \%\ As\ Fed $$

| Nutrient | Content |
|:--------:|:-------:|
| Moisture (%) | 68.0 |
| Crude Protein (%) | 42.5 |
| Crude Fat (%) | 10.5 |
| Ash (%) | 9.2 |
|Metabolizable Energy (kcal) | 4.2  |


Since the ME was not included in the source, I have calculated it myself below with Atwater's equation<sup>22</sup>, modified for kcal/100 g.

$$ ME\ (kcal/g)\ =\ ×\ (4\ ×\ Crude\ Protein\ %\ +\ 9\ ×\ Crude\ Fat\ %\ +\ 4\ ×\ Nitrogen-Free\ Extract\ %) $$

$$ ME\ (kcal/k)\ =\ (9\ x\ 42.5g)\ +\ (4\ x\ 10.5g)\ +\ (4\ x\ 0g) $$

$$ ME\ =\ 424.5\ kcal/100 g,\ or\ 4.2\ kcal/g $$

## Nutritional Value and Energy Content of Snow Goose Eggs
For fresh eggs, the fat content is about 14.4g (or around 44.8%) and protein content is about 16.1g (50.4%), and there is an average of 873 kJ of energy<sup>10</sup>. The ash content was assumed to be the same whether the eggs were fresh or stored<sup>10</sup>. The metabolizable energy of fresh eggs was calculated to be 816 kJ<sup>10</sup>. The masses of the fresh eggs, when dried, was an average of 31.97g, and since they were an average of 169.98g before moisture was removed, that makes the moisture content 81.2%<sup>10</sup>. The shells and membranes of the eggs were removed before analysis, so all of the following data is excluding shells and membranes<sup>10</sup>.

Fresh Eggs:

| Nutrient | Content |
|:--------:|:-------:|
| Moisture (%) | 81.2 |
| Crude Protein (%) | 50.4 |
|Fat (%) |  44.8 |
| Ash (%) | 4.8 |
| Gross Energy | 873 kJ or 208.7 kcal |
| Metabolizable Energy | 816 kJ or 195.0 kcal |

Fats are 96% digestible and proteins are 8% digestible in food sources such as eggs<sup>10</sup>. This information was taken from blue foxes, but was assumed to also apply to the Arctic fox<sup>10</sup>.

However, as mentioned above the foxes also cache these eggs, so fat, protein, and energy contents were also calculated for stored eggs. When the eggs have been stored, the fat content is about 12.7g (43.8%) and the protein content was about 14.8g (51.3%)<sup>10</sup>. Ash content of stored eggs was 4.8%, and the energy content has an average of 783 kJ<sup>10</sup>. The metabolizable energy of stored eggs was calculated to be 730 kJ<sup>10</sup>.

Stored Eggs:

| Nutrient | Content |
|:--------:|:-------:|
| Moisture (%) | Not Analyzed |
|Protein (%) | 51.3 |
| Fat (%) | 43.8 |
|Ash (%) | 4.8 |
| Gross Energy | 783 kJ or 187.1 kcal |
| Metabolizable Energy | 730 kJ or 174.5 kcal |


This data is from a single study that was performed in the summers of 1989-1990 and 2004, and had a fairly low sample sizes due to the fact that the eggs were collected from national parks and therefore there were constraints on what could be taken<sup>10</sup>.

Due to the fact that the above data does not include all proximate analysis data, namely carbohydrates, I am also providing proximate analysis data for goose eggs below. The data below is from a study performed on duck and goose eggs in Bangladesh<sup>23</sup>.

| Nutrient | Content |
|:--------:|:-------:|
| Moisture (%) | 68.76 |
| Protein (%) | 13.86 |
| Fat (%) | 13.27 |
| Ash (%) | 1.13 |
| Carbohydrate (%) | 2.98 |
| Energy (kcal) | 263.23 |

There are some major differences between the Greater Snow Goose eggs and the goose eggs from the Bangladesh study. I attribute this partially to the fact that the Bangladesh study seems to have included the shells in their analysis, which were left out in the other study. The Bangladesh study also did not specify the species of goose this data came from, however I feel it is safe to assume that it is not the Greater Snow Goose, so there may be species differences between the nutrient contents of the eggs. They also have very low protein and fat values, which I find strange, however these are the values they included in their paper.
